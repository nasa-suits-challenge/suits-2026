# Human‑in‑the‑Loop (HITL) Test Plan

## Schedule (draft)
- **Nov–Dec 2025**: Bench tests (UI latency, voice, C&W rules).  
- **Jan 2026**: Outdoor night walks (lighting, contrast, breadcrumb fidelity).  
- **Feb 2026**: Full PR–EV thread w/ simulated TSS; beacon “warmer/colder” trials.  
- **Mar 2026**: Fault‑injection & time‑pressure runs; dress rehearsal for SDR (Apr 2).

## Protocol
- **Participants**: 8–12 healthy adults (gloves where applicable); mix of technical/non‑technical.  
- **Tasks**: UIA egress; nav to LTV; ERM→Diagnosis→Nav restart→Physical repair; ingress.  
- **Measures**: time‑to‑complete; error counts; NASA‑TLX; situation awareness (SAGAT‑lite); alert ACK latency.  
- **Safety**: low‑speed movement; spotters; terrain brief; device straps & covers; night lighting controls.

## Data & Analysis
- Screen/voice logs; TSS streams; waypoint traces; incident reports; SUS/NASA‑TLX questionnaires.  
- Acceptance: meet PRD metrics; identify top 5 UX risks with mitigations before SDR.
