# TUXEDO Software Design Review Brief

Prepared for the FY26 NASA SUITS virtual Software Design Review (Apr 2, 2026).
This brief distills the proposal package into an SDR-ready narrative and flags
items that still require closure.

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Mission focus:** Deliver synchronized rover and EVA interfaces (TUXEDO) that
  guide lunar surface operations with pass-through augmented reality, telemetry
  verification, and the Athena AI assistant.
- **Core value:** Reduce cognitive load during search, repair, and ingress tasks
  by enforcing telemetry-validated procedures, resource-aware navigation, and
  concise AI advisories.
- **Readiness snapshot:** Architecture and CONOPS are mature; AI guardrails,
  late-stage HITL validation, and hardware sourcing (loaner HoloLens 2) remain on
  the critical path for SDR approval.

## 2. System Overview
### 2.1 Architecture Highlights
- Unified Telemetry Stream Server (TSS) client feeds both PR and EV clients over
  JSON/GeoJSON WebSockets.
- Athena AI spans an on-suit node (speech, AGR progression) and an edge/rover
  node (planning, RAG, analytics) with shared tool APIs.
- Navigation & analytics layer provides A*-based routing, hazard weighting, and
  consumable forecasting; outputs drive AGR and UI cues.
- Lightweight, glanceable UIs (PR map + panels, EV minimap + status tiles) share
  POIs, timers, and warnings via a minimal schema with offline caching.

### 2.2 Pressurized Rover UI
- Multi-panel display for rover telemetry, 2D terrain map, caution/warning feed,
  consumables chart, and mission timers.
- Autonomy supports adaptive search patterns around the LTV, LiDAR-assisted
  obstacle avoidance (<10 m), and turnaround radius visualizations.
- Crew can drop and annotate POIs by voice/touch; advisories resync after
  connectivity drops.

### 2.3 EVA Spacesuit UI
- Pass-through AR headset paired with a wrist tablet balances high-priority HUD
  content (biomed, cautions, AGR prompts) and lower-priority map/inputs.
- Provides suit/biomed tiles, route planning with breadcrumb return, predictive
  range rings, and contextual AI voice assistance.
- Procedures module highlights UIA/DCU/LTV controls, advancing only after TSS
  verification; caution logic escalates urgent anomalies with audio + visual
  cues.

### 2.4 AGR Overlay Engine
- Five overlay modes (highlight, motion, hand hints, tool cues, contextual
  widgets) map to procedure steps to keep astronauts heads-up and in-scene.
- Spatial registration uses HMD scans and lightweight detectors; telemetry stays
  authoritative for switch state changes.
- AGR state syncs across PRâ†”EV JSON channel to maintain shared awareness during
  brief link losses.

### 2.5 Athena AI & Guardrails
- On-suit services handle offline ASR/TTS, AGR sequencing, hazard cues,
  breadcrumbing, and telemetry read-outs.
- Edge/rover node hosts quantized 7â€“13B LLM (optionally 20B with approved
  compute pack) for multi-constraint planning and retrieval-augmented guidance.
- Structured tool layer (`get_telemetry`, `plan_route`, `predict_resources`,
  `checklist`, `beacon_bearing`) produces deterministic JSON envelopes.
- Guardrails enforce telemetry as source of truth, confidence gating (<0.8),
  two-step confirmations for routing/ERM, and deterministic fallbacks when tools
  fail.

## 3. Hardware, Networking, and Compliance
- Devices: HoloLens 2 (pass-through AR), wrist-mounted tablet, PR workstation,
  edge laptop with â‰¥16 GB VRAM for the LLM node, and WebSocket comms between PR
  and EV.
- Networking targets SUITSNET-only connectivity during Test Week; no public
  internet dependencies.
- Compliance checks already align with SUITS UI requirements (2D minimap,
  breadcrumbs, drop pins, hazard alerts, predictive range, search radius, AIA
  status) and pass-through AR mobility expectations.
- Program selects Hololens2 Loan Program Option B (loaned device required), so
  NASA coordination for hardware logistics must stay on-track.

## 4. Concept of Operations
| Phase | Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| A. PR Search & Approach | Adaptive search around last-known LTV point, range awareness, AIA advisories. |
| B. Egress (UIA/DCU) | AGR highlights physical controls, voice confirmations gated by TSS telemetry. |
| C. EV Navigation | Low-light-safe cues, breadcrumb returns, hazard pips, range rings. |
| D. LTV Repair | Step-wise AGR overlays for ERM â†’ diagnosis â†’ restart â†’ physical repair, with defer options when resources low. |
| E. Ingress | Resource-aware return path, ingress checklist verification, synchronized logging back to PR. |

## 5. Development Plan & Milestones
- Two-week sprint cadence with GitHub issue tracking and weekly demos.
- Decâ€“Jan: Deliver TSS client, PR/EV UI shells, core mapping features.
- Feb: Implement search patterns, EV navigation, procedure engine, caution
  handling.
- Mar: Complete LTV repair flow, AI guardrails, range/turnaround analytics, and
  night testing.
- Apr: SDR build freeze, end-to-end rehearsal, bug burn-down.
- May/Jun: Onsite testing readiness, telemetry logging, white paper & code wrap.

## 6. Test & Evaluation Strategy
- Bi-weekly HITL trials Janâ€“Apr with DUST simulator feeds and outdoor night
  traverses.
- Metrics: latency (<250 ms), schema integrity, path error (â‰¤3 m), hazard
  avoidance (â‰¥95%), procedure accuracy, warning response time, NASA-TLX (<40
  median), task duration, and deferral correctness.
- Participant pool: 12â€“18 CU Boulder students/faculty with mixed technical
  backgrounds; privacy ensured via consent forms and anonymized voice logs.
- Post-test cycles integrate quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback before
  promoting features to the main build.

## 7. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Network latency or SUITSNET dropouts | Delayed overlays, stale telemetry | Local caching, stale-data badges, PR log replay. |
| Device thermal limits / compute load | HMD throttling during night ops | Thermal monitoring, load shedding, offloading planning to edge node. |
| ASR robustness in noisy environments | Missed commands / false positives | Offline grammar set, deterministic fallbacks, voice + touch redundancy. |
| Hardware availability (loaned HoloLens 2, edge GPU) | Schedule slip / non-compliance | Track loan request status, secure backup device, confirm GPU inventory. |
| AI guardrail gaps | Unsafe guidance or hallucinations | Telemetry-first validation, confidence gating, deterministic responses for low confidence. |

## 8. Outstanding Actions for SDR
1. Confirm final hardware logistics with NASA loan program and document backup
   devices.
2. Produce initial AGR overlay prototypes (video/screenshot) to demonstrate the
   five-mode palette in context.
3. Lock AI model selection (7â€“13B baseline vs. optional 20B) and benchmark on the
   target edge laptop to validate latency.
4. Finalize telemetry schema contract (POIs, timers, warnings) and publish to the
   rover/EV teams for integration tests.
5. Dry-run January HITL smoke tests (TSS client, WebSocket latency) and archive
   logs for SDR evidence.

| Architecture & CONOPS | ðŸŸ¢ On-track | System overview, AGR concept, and phased CONOPS are fully documented. |
| AI & Autonomy | ðŸŸ¡ Needs validation | Guardrails defined; performance and model sizing still pending hardware tests. |
| UI/UX Implementation | ðŸŸ¡ In progress | Wireframes and feature lists are solid; requires prototype capture for SDR. |
| Testing & Metrics | ðŸŸ¢ Planned | Detailed HITL schedule and metrics cover SDR expectations. |
| Hardware & Logistics | ðŸŸ¡ Watch | Loaner request and edge GPU sourcing remain open tasks. |
