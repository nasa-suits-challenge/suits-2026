# Vision & Method

**Vision:** Build a calm, astronaut-first UI and AIA that reduces cognitive load, speaks in concise numbers when stakes are high, and keeps crews safe in lunar night conditions.

**Method:**
- Evidence-based design: wireframes → prototypes → HITL.
- Guardrailed AIA: task-graph + deterministic checks for critical procedures.
- Interoperability: shared POIs, paths, and C&W between PR and EV via TSS.
