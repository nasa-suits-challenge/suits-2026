# FY26 NASA Mission Documents

This folder collects the official FY26 NASA SUITS references we cite throughout the project. It contains the FAQs, mission description, and proposal guidelines that came directly from the competition brief, plus their .md files for quick agentic reference.

Keeping these documents together makes it easier to point new teammates at the authoritative mission language and reduces clutter in the top-level `docs/` directory.
