# NASA SUITS Proposal Rubric Requirements

This checklist distills the proposal scoring rubric from the FY26 NASA SUITS Proposal Guidelines. Use it as a test document when drafting proposals so that every scoring criterion is addressed at the desired performance level.

## Technical Merit (Total 80 points)

### Design Description (25 points)
- **Core requirements**
  - State clear goals for the design concept and articulate the expected results.
  - Outline a roadmap for integrating artificial intelligence to support autonomous functions.
  - Address every required challenge component: user interfaces for the spacesuit and pressurized rover, navigation support, and autonomy/interoperability capabilities.
- **Scoring expectations**
  - *0–6 pts*: Missing or unclear goals/results, little evidence of innovative UI or display interaction methods, and at most one challenge component met.
  - *7–13 pts*: Goals/results are vague, minimal innovation evidence, and only two challenge components satisfied.
  - *14–19 pts*: Goals/results generally described with some innovation evidence and at least three challenge components satisfied.
  - *20–25 pts*: Goals/results are concise and convincing, substantial innovation evidence (visuals, etc.), and most or all challenge components satisfied.

### Concept of Operations (10 points)
- **Core requirements**
  - Describe the user interfaces, autonomy behaviors, and interoperability for both the pressurized rover and the spacesuit from an operational point of view.
- **Scoring expectations**
  - *0–1 pts*: Concept description is unclear and insufficient operationally.
  - *2–4 pts*: Concept contains few details and is hard to understand operationally.
  - *5–7 pts*: Concept gives general details that support a minimal operational understanding.
  - *8–10 pts*: Concept is thorough, clear, and operationally informative.

### Feasibility (10 points)
- **Core requirements**
  - Demonstrate that the concept delivers a viable solution to the stated technical need.
  - Explain how the concept will be produced, including supporting evidence.
- **Scoring expectations**
  - *0–2 pts*: Lacks viability, fails to meet the technical need, and provides no production evidence.
  - *3–5 pts*: Shows low viability or minor contributions with little production evidence.
  - *6–8 pts*: Demonstrates sufficient viability with minimal production evidence.
  - *9–10 pts*: Demonstrates high viability, significant contributions, and detailed production evidence.

### Artificial Intelligence Integration (15 points)
- **Core requirements**
  - Explain how and where AI (including LLMs or other models) will be incorporated.
  - Justify the choice of AI models and their relevance to the problem.
  - Present a plan to mitigate hallucinations or other AI failure modes that could jeopardize mission success.
- **Scoring expectations**
  - *0–3 pts*: Fails to explain AI integration, model choices, or mitigation strategies.
  - *4–7 pts*: Provides basic AI integration and mitigation plans with vague or impractical details; weak model justification.
  - *8–11 pts*: Offers practical AI integration and mitigation with reasonable, but not comprehensive, justification.
  - *12–15 pts*: Delivers a comprehensive, innovative AI plan with clear model selection rationale and robust hallucination mitigation.

### Effectiveness of the Proposed Project Schedule (5 points)
- **Core requirements**
  - Present a comprehensive schedule that documents objectives, milestones, and task sequencing.
  - Show effective use of resources and labor distribution for accomplishing each objective or task.
- **Scoring expectations**
  - *0 pts*: Schedule shows ineffective planning with little or no detail on meeting objectives.
  - *1–2 pts*: Schedule has few details and only vague descriptions of how objectives will be met.
  - *3–4 pts*: Schedule includes minimum detail to demonstrate effective planning.
  - *5 pts*: Schedule is highly detailed and demonstrates a complete plan to meet objectives.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Testing (10 points)
- **Core requirements**
  - Provide a comprehensive test plan covering all HITL evaluations.
  - Include schedule of test events, protocols, metrics/measures, subject pools/demographics, and how each event validates challenge requirements.
  - Ensure all HITL activities are planned with safety in mind.
- **Scoring expectations**
  - *1–2 pts*: Plan is missing or insufficient, unsafe, or unclear.
  - *3–5 pts*: Plan includes only a few required components for an effective, safe test.
  - *6–7 pts*: Plan covers most required components but lacks full detail.
  - *8–10 pts*: Plan clearly and concisely details every component for effective, safe HITL testing.

### Technical References (5 points)
- **Core requirements**
  - Cite relevant works within the proposal text and provide a bibliography.
- **Scoring expectations**
  - *0 pts*: No references included.
  - *1–2 pts*: Single citation present but improperly formatted.
  - *3–4 pts*: At least one properly formatted citation and reference entry.
  - *5 pts*: Two or more properly formatted citations and references.

## Engagement Plan (Total 40 points)

### Community Engagements (up to 20 points)
- **Core requirements**
  - Present a diverse list of planned events/activities, projected audiences, participant counts, engaged community leaders, and a detailed implementation plan.
- **Scoring expectations**
  - *1–5 pts*: Only one event planned with minimal implementation details.
  - *6–10 pts*: At least two events with sufficiently detailed implementation, audience, and participant projections.
  - *11–15 pts*: At least three events with highly descriptive, relevant implementation details.
  - *16–20 pts*: At least four events with comprehensive implementation detail covering audiences, participation, and leader engagement.

### Industry Engagements (up to 20 points)
- **Core requirements**
  - List potential partners, describe alignment with project goals, and outline the team’s professional development strategy.
- **Scoring expectations**
  - *1–5 pts*: Provides minimal detail on potential partners or alignment.
  - *6–10 pts*: Supplies sufficient partner details and goal alignment.
  - *11–15 pts*: Offers highly descriptive, relevant partner details with clear alignment to project goals.
  - *16–20 pts*: Presents comprehensive partner plans tightly aligned to goals and professional development strategies.

## Usage Guidance
- Treat each rubric category as a gating requirement; missing criteria in any section will reduce the overall score.
- Use this checklist as a QA artifact when drafting the proposal to confirm readiness before submission.
