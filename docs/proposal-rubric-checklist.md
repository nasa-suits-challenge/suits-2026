# NASA SUITS Proposal Rubric Checklist

This checklist captures every criterion described in the FY26 NASA SUITS proposal scoring rubric. Use it as a test document to self-evaluate draft proposals before submission.

## Technical Merit (Total: 70 points)

### Design Description (25 points)
- [ ] Clearly describe overall goals, expected results, and innovations in the UI concept for both spacesuit and pressurized rover experiences.
- [ ] Provide visuals or other evidence that demonstrate novel interaction methods/technologies.
- [ ] Address **all** required challenge components: astronaut wearable UI, pressurized rover UI, navigation, autonomy, and interoperability requirements.
- [ ] Explain how AI integrates into the UI/UX to satisfy challenge requirements.

**Scoring bands for reference**
- 0-6 pts: Insufficient or unclear goals/results; little or no evidence of innovative UI or component coverage.
- 7-13 pts: Vague goals/results; minimal innovation evidence; only two components met.
- 14-19 pts: General goals/results; some innovation evidence; at least three components met.
- 20-25 pts: Clear, concise goals/results; substantial innovation evidence; nearly all components met.

### Concept of Operations (10 points)
- [ ] Describe UI, autonomy, and interoperability workflows from the astronaut/operator perspective for both spacesuit and pressurized rover contexts.
- [ ] Demonstrate that the concept is viable, contributes to the technical need, and can realistically be produced.
- [ ] Provide supporting evidence (e.g., diagrams, narratives) showing how the CONOPS will be executed.

**Scoring bands for reference**
- 0-2 pts: Unclear or insufficient operational description.
- 3-5 pts: Few details; difficult to comprehend operational flow.
- 6-8 pts: Adequate detail but limited viability evidence.
- 9-10 pts: Highly detailed, viable concept with clear production path.

### Artificial Intelligence Integration (15 points)
- [ ] Identify where and how AI augments the system to improve efficiency and reduce cognitive load.
- [ ] Specify the LLMs or other AI models to be used and justify their selection.
- [ ] Outline robust strategies to mitigate hallucinations or other mission-risk behaviors.
- [ ] Demonstrate deep understanding of the operational problem and AI solution fit.

**Scoring bands for reference**
- 0-3 pts: Fails to explain AI inclusion, model choice, or risk mitigation.
- 4-7 pts: Basic explanations lacking depth, practicality, or justification.
- 8-11 pts: Practical integration with reasonable justification and mitigation plans.
- 12-15 pts: Comprehensive, innovative AI plan with well-justified models and mitigation strategies.

### Project Schedule Effectiveness (5 points)
- [ ] Provide a comprehensive development schedule (e.g., Gantt or Agile plan) covering all objectives.
- [ ] Detail resource usage, labor distribution, and checkpoints for meeting milestones.
- [ ] Demonstrate a clear, achievable path to accomplish every task before Test Week.

**Scoring bands for reference**
- 0 pts: No effective planning or task descriptions.
- 1-2 pts: Sparse details; unclear path to objectives.
- 3-4 pts: Minimal detail; objectives barely addressed.
- 5 pts: Highly detailed, effective plan covering all tasks.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Testing (10 points)
- [ ] Present a complete HITL test plan covering schedule, protocols, metrics, subject demographics, and safety measures.
- [ ] Show how each test event evaluates the design against challenge requirements.
- [ ] Demonstrate readiness for full-mission rehearsal prior to Test Week.

**Scoring bands for reference**
- 1-2 pts: Missing or unsafe HITL plan.
- 3-5 pts: Few required components present.
- 6-7 pts: Most components present but lacking completeness.
- 8-10 pts: Thorough, safe plan addressing all required components.

### Technical References (5 points)
- [ ] Cite all referenced works within the text.
- [ ] Provide a properly formatted bibliography with at least two references.
- [ ] Ensure citations follow a recognized technical format.

**Scoring bands for reference**
- 0 pts: No references.
- 1-2 pts: Single, improperly formatted reference.
- 3-4 pts: At least one properly formatted reference.
- 5 pts: Two or more properly formatted references.

## Engagement Plan (Total: 20 points)

### Community Engagements (10 points)
- [ ] Plan at least four outreach events (combined with industry engagements) including at least one distinct community engagement.
- [ ] Provide a detailed implementation plan with objectives, locations, timelines, and aligned educational standards where applicable.
- [ ] Identify target audiences and expected participant counts for each event.
- [ ] Document engagement with community leaders and any supporting letters or agreements.
- [ ] Include press and/or social media amplification strategies.
- [ ] Connect each activity to NASA SUITS, a NASA mission, or the teamâ€™s code.

**Scoring bands for reference**
- 1-5 pts: Single event or no implementation/audience detail.
- 6-10 pts: Two events with minimal detail.
- 11-15 pts: Three events with sufficient detail (combined scoring with industry engagements).
- 16-20 pts: Four or more events with highly descriptive, relevant plans.

### Industry Engagements (10 points)
- [ ] Compile a detailed list of aligned industry partners and the value they provide (mentorship, skills, certifications, resources).
- [ ] Outline professional development strategies (mentorships, certifications, internships, etc.).
- [ ] Explain how industry relationships advance team career goals and project success.
- [ ] Describe outreach or communication plans to raise awareness about NASA SUITS participation.

**Scoring bands for reference**
- Mirrors community engagement scoring (1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20) based on number of total events and plan detail.

## Administrative Compliance (Required but Not Scored)
- [ ] Institutional letter of endorsement on appropriate letterhead from president, dean, or department chair.
- [ ] Supervising faculty statement (with required language) on letterhead and signature, plus additional letters for partner institutions.
- [ ] Optional Statement of Rights of Use signed by all team members and faculty (earns greater consideration if included).
- [ ] Funding and budget statement with itemized costs and potential funding sources.
- [ ] Indicate Hololens2 loan request status (needs, has, or would like additional device).
- [ ] Provide institution and team logos (horizontal and vertical variants) via upload or link.
